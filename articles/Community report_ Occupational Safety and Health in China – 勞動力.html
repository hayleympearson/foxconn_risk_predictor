<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The procedure to seek compensation is regulated by the Work Injury Insurance Law<a name="_GoBack"></a>, the Law on&nbsp;Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases, and the Production&nbsp;Safety Law. In order to seek compensation, the Work Injury Certification is used to identify and confirm that the injury was caused by a job-related issue or accident; the Identification on Work Ability is used to identify the level of disability caused by the injury. There are four major steps in the process to seek compensation. First, workers must have their injury identified as an occupational injury, for which they need to apply for the Work Injury Certification within one year after the </span><span lang="EN-GB">accident happened in the workplace. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Second, workers must apply for the Identification on Work Ability and wait for the results of this evaluation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">To add to this painstaking and time-consuming legal procedure, there are a number of additional barriers, which include the labour contract, or the occupational disease diagnosis. Yet even before the compensation can be sought, the injured worker</span><span lang="EN-GB">s</span><span lang="EN-GB"> have to submit his or her labour contract to the authorities to prove the existence of a ‘labour relationship’ with the employer. Ironically, this is one of the greatest difficulties faced by the injured worker. This was vividly shown in the “Executive Summary of the China Labour Contract Law Implementation Survey, 2009”, a report on the Pearl River Delta region (PRD) conducted by a workers’ centre based in Shenzhen:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 32.5pt 0.0001pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span><em>“The percentage of respondents having signed a written labour contract in the Pearl River Delta is 67.30 percent and in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) it is 83 percent. The common contract period is one to three years, and only 8 percent of respondents have permanent contracts. Overall, about 75 percent of respondents report having signed labour contracts with their employer in the YRD and PRD. Enterprises with 100 employees or less were found less likely to have signed labour contracts at all </em>(“Executive Summary of the China Labour Contract Law Implementation Survey, 2009”, Dagongzhe Centre).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">In fact, there is a relationship between the size of the enterprise and the rate of occupational accidents. The findings of one workers centre show more than 50 percent of all accidents happen in factories with fewer than 250 workers. </span></p>

Many occupational disease victims have been trapped for years just in the process of obtaining the certification, before&nbsp;entering into the legal proceedings to seek compensation. Due to this lengthy process, some workers even die before they can obtain the work injury certification. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

Thereafter, depending on the disability level, the average wage will be provided for a fixed period (calculated in months). Hence, workers have to provide evidence or proof of the average wage of his previous position in the twelve months before the work injury occurred. The worker’s difficulties do not end there. If the worker has not kept the pay sheets (pay slips) for the past 12 months – and many have not – he or she must get copies from the MHRSS or employer who may have understated payment in order to lessen the company’s social insurance payments. The Social Insurance Law requires that the employer and the worker share the payment of the social insurance, with specific proportions of the actual wages<a name="_ftnref10" href="http://www.workerempowerment.org/en/research-reports/26?fbclid=IwAR1OCwRP2SNvs6m-jFa6qLeJe60anpe9GUW4-DN9AjpzyasQw7pA9DIfbDI#_ftn10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;" lang="EN-GB">[10]</span></span></span></span></a> paid by each to the Social Insurance Fund on a monthly basis. In practice, most of the employers use the minimum wage to pay their proportion to the Social Insurance Fund, which will affect the calculation of the compensation because when the worker has no proof of the real wages he/she has been receiving, the compensation is calculated with the average wages records of the MHRSS (records coming from the Social Insurance Fund) and that reflect a much lower average wage than the workers’ real wage. This makes the compensation lower than the actual amount workers should receive. To demand for a fair compensation workers have to enter into litigation following the legal procedures.</span></p>

After he was diagnosed with acute leukaemia in the hospital and was identified as a potential case of occupational disease, he approached his employer to demand that he take care of the medical expenses. But the employer refused. Like many other patients with occupational diseases, Ng had to overcome many difficulties in the long and tedious process to claim his rights. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Generally, the first problem is that the employer always refuses to pay for medical and living expenses during the application period of occupational disease diagnosis. Even if the employee is identified as a victim of an occupational disease, it is very difficult for him or her to claim back the medical and living expenses from the company. During the application period of occupational disease diagnosis, Ng’s employer did not provide necessary evidence of the use of toxic chemicals in the factory, which slowed down the entire process. After the Workplace Injury Identification was finally approved, the employer did not comply with the law and did not pay for Ng’s salary and other expenses during the treatment period. Ng was even forced to sign an agreement with the employer to reduce the cost of living payments that the company should pay.<span> </span></span></p>

It is apparent that there exist great problems in the enforcement of the Work Injury Insurance Law at many levels of government, and patients with occupational diseases are not only unfairly treated under the existing system, but are also trapped in its tedious procedures.<span> </span></span></p>

From that year until 2010, a total of 500 workers were diagnosed with excessive cadmium levels in the blood, and 22 workers were identified to have been cadmium poisoned. Gold Peak Industrial Ltd. is an Asian transnational corporation (TNC) based in Hong Kong and Singapore. GP’s customers include EverReady, Siemens, Panasonic, Nikon, Canon, Rayovac and Toshiba. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">Cadmium is a chemical used to produce batteries. Workers affected with cadmium will face health problems for years even if they do not show symptoms of illness at the time of coming into contact with this chemical. Gold  Peak (GP) which had been producing batteries since the mid-1980s, provided totally ineffective masks to their staff, which resulted in workers inhaling the fine cadmium powder. The company even ordered pregnant women to process cadmium alongside non-pregnant women</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">. As a result, the </span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">children of these women were also found to have high-levels of cadmium in their bodies due to their mother</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">s</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"> daily contact with the substance. </span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">In 2004, </span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">greatly suspicion of the official medical tests arranged by the management of the factory, some of these Gold Peak (GP) workers went to the Guangdong  Provincial Hospital for the Prevention and Treatment of Occupational Diseases to have new medical tests done. The results of these tests were alarming and </span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB">showed that</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"> the levels of cadmium in their body were much higher than the tests they had been done at the request of the factory management. The 500 workers were outraged and staged a three-day strike in June, 2004, demanding the Gold Peak (GP) management recognize the accuracy of the second set of test results performed by the provincial hospital and asked for financial coverage for proper medical treatment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;" lang="EN-GB">According to an interview with five Gold Peak (GP) employees who had been shown to have cadmium poisoning, they had been going through a long battle with the company to fight for their rights and compensation. Gold  Peak (GP) at one point forced them to resign and sign unfair compensation agreements. The affected workers were under great pressure from the company and the local authorities, which included close surveillance of their actions and even violent assaults. In response, workers at the factories went on strikes, staged protests, met with government officials, and filed a lawsuit to exert pressure on the company. With the support from labour groups in Hong Kong, a number of demonstrations were held at the offices of Gold Peak (GP) in Hong Kong Worker representatives also visited trade unions in Europe seeking assistance. After six years of struggle, in</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;" lang="EN-GB"> September 2010, 152 former workers from the Huizhou factory of Gold Peak (GP), all with excessive cadmium levels in their systems, won their lawsuit against Gold Peak (GP). The court found in favour of the workers’ claim for RMB 6.03 million cash compensation. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;" lang="EN-GB">Workers were also granted </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;" lang="EN-GB">nutrition fees and wages based on average monthly salary of the urban residents. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Chen, a 45 year old male worker in the furniture manufacturing industry, suffered his injury on March, 2011. In the previous ten years, Chen had worked in eight different factories, seven of which producing furniture. In January 2011, Chen resigned from his position. After the Chinese New Year, Kanan, a furniture making factory recruited workers for their craft production line. This specific production process required very experienced and skilful workers as some tools with sharp edges are used to make the carved patterns on the wood furniture. Chen started working at Kanan factory on February 24, 2011, and signed a labour contract with Kanan which gave him a monthly salary of Rmb2,200-2,300  a month, two holidays per month, and a work schedule from 8am to 9pm. The manager made an oral agreement with Chen that work injury insurance would be provided at a later date. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Chen was sent to the production line with no training whatsoever, and the division manager just asked him to observe and learn how the other workers used the machines and the tools. As Chen had not worked in such a </span><span lang="EN-GB">skilled carvers division</span><span lang="EN-GB"> before, the production process was new for him. Six days after entering the factory, on March 3, 2011, when Chen was carving the patterns on a wardrobe, he severely injured the palm of his left hand. The other workers at the workplace tried to stop the bleeding and immediately sent Chen to the hospital. At the time, Kanan paid a deposit (part of the treatment fees) to the hospital and agreed to pay an injury compensation without mentioning any specific amount.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">As Kanan had not yet provided Chen with work injury insurance, it was actually obliged to pay the treatment fees and other compensation payments in full. For this reason, Kanan’s management was not willing to report the injury to the Bureau of Labour and Social Security. However, when Chen’s condition stabilized, he applied for the Work Injury Certification and for the identification of the level of disability, which was set at level 10. However, throughout this process, Kanan was not cooperative. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">In July 2011, Kanan started to put pressure on Chen to resign, but he refused and reported Kanan’s behaviour to the Bureau of Labour and Social Security. The bureau initiated consultations and discussion with both Kanan and Chen</span><span lang="EN-GB"> individually</span><span lang="EN-GB">, but failed to resolve the issue. Thereafter, Chen prepared the necessary</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB">material and applied for the Bureau of Labour and Social Security’s arbitration committee. At the end of July, the same day that Chen handed in the arbitration request to the bureau, Kanan informed the bureau of its willingness to discuss the issue again. Hence, Kanan’s management and Chen met up and Kanan offered Rmb15,000 in compensation to Chen. Chen initially refused. However, due to the anxieties over the length of the process and his housing and living expenses, Chen</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB">finally settled for Rmb20,000 in compensation. This, however, was only 59 percent of what he was legally entitled to as compensation.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">NGOs’ strategies have the common goal of empowering workers to self-organize and pursue their rights autonomously.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The real </span><span style="color: #212121;" lang="EN-GB">statistics</span><span lang="EN-GB"> on occupational hazards and accidents in China remains unkown, which is believed to be highly underestimated and underreported due to poor enforcement and monitoring of </span><span lang="EN-GB">OSH</span><span lang="EN-GB">-related laws, </span><span lang="EN-GB">cumbersome, lengthy process of verification of injury and degree of disability</span><span lang="EN-GB"> and a lack of an accountable and transparent mechanism to compile statistics. Worse still, the hidden problems are diffusing into other Asian countries.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">In the process of global industrial relocation, enterprises seek locations with the lowest costs, and with lax and imperfect laws and regulations to reduce productivity risks (as avoiding raising production costs). In 2011, the relocation of enterprises settled in China has followed two paths: towards China’s hinterland or towards Southeast Asian countries. With the new industrial set-ups following the old models, these have incited the emergence of labour and OSH problems in other countries. In fact, the OSH problems in these new locations appear as serious as in previous location in China, and workers also face low wages and casualization of labour. The need for a hike in the minimum wage rate and the casualization of labour are common issues that workers across countries are protesting against.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">We can assume workers in other countries in Asia are facing similar situations and problems as in China. Hence, we emphasize the importance of further investigating OSH conditions in China and elsewhere, not only because the data itself is unreliable, but also because it will provide the basis to further advocate for improvements of OSH conditions across the region. To better understand the situations on the ground, and to allow workers to better make claims and demand their rights and improvement of the labour conditions, further research is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">The most critical challenge for most workers and labour NGOs in Asian countries is to find ways to contribute to the improvement of OSH conditions in a more open and sustainable way under authoritarian regimes. Indeed, if we have the strong conviction that OSH is a basic human right, NGOs should mobilise resources to demand these rights and seek spaces for workers to enjoy their rights in an autonomous and collective way. Of course, the sustainable strategy is to empower workers to demand their rights themselves. Workers must realise that they are the key actors, they must make themselves visible, and they should speak out, learn, and be actively involved in monitoring their working conditions with their employers.</span></p>
